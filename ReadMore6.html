                    Doha: Ooredoo, major supporter of sport across all levels, signed a three-year sponsorship agreement
                    with athlete Mutaz Barshim.
                    <br />
                    The agreement was signed at Ooredoo Headquarters by Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulla Al Thani — Deputy
                    Group Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer of Ooredoo Qatar — and Barshim.
                    <br />
                    Barshim is a Qatari track and field athlete and a triple Olympic medallist (one gold and two silver)
                    in the high jump. The current World Champion and second best high jumper of all-time, with a
                    personal best of 2.43 metres, he won gold at the 2017 World Championships in London and at the 2019
                    World Championships in Doha.
                    <br />
                    Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulla Al Thani said: “Ooredoo’s sponsorship of Mutaz Barshim is one of several
                    initiatives from the company to encourage sports education and inspire more young people to take up
                    a sport of their own, as part of our corporate social responsibility. To date, Barshim has
                    demonstrated through his career the positive values of fair play and sporting excellence.”
                    <br />
                    “From amateur, grass-roots sports to the highest standards of performance at national and
                    international, Ooredoo aims to be there supporting our athletes,” he added.
                    <br />
                    Mutaz Barshim welcomed Ooredoo’s support and praised its role in supporting athletes and motivating
                    them to excel, stressing that this sponsorship represents an incentive for him to continue success
                    and excellence in the upcoming competitions.
