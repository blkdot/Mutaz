                            <i><b>Barshim joins the airline’s diverse portfolio of sports sponsorships</b></i>
                            <br /><br />

                            Qatar Airways is excited to announce a partnership with Olympic Gold medallist and Qatari
                            high jump star and sports icon, Mutaz Barshim, further diversifying the airline’s renowned
                            sports sponsorships portfolio.
                            <br />
                            After immediately making an impact at the young age of 19 by setting the Qatari high jump
                            record, Barshim consequently went on to set new standards by recording the second highest
                            jump of all time at 2.43 metres. The award-winning athlete has attained several prestigious
                            accolades over the years, which include the recent gold medal at 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the
                            gold medal at the World Championships in 2017 and 2019, respectively, and the silver medal
                            at 2016 Rio Olympics. His gravity defying performances merited the award for ‘2017 Athlete
                            of the Year’ by the Association of National Olympic Committee and ‘Best Track & Field
                            Athlete of 2017’ by the International Association of Athletics Federation, amongst several
                            others.
                            <br />
                            Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive, His Excellency Mr. Akbar Al Baker, said: “Mutaz Barshim
                            holds high recognition amongst the world’s most renowned athletes, having amassed a
                            portfolio of high jump titles. As we celebrate his latest win at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, we
                            could not be more proud, and we hope that Barshim continues to soar high and set new
                            records, which will create a ripple effect of inspiring young athletes within Qatar and
                            around the world. We are continually striving to boost our global sports sponsorship
                            portfolio, and this partnership is just one more example of our dedication to sports and our
                            belief in its power to bring people together.”
                            <br />
                            Qatari High Jump Athlete, Mutaz Barshim, said: “‘I am happy and excited for this partnership
                            with the world’s best airline. I truly appreciate Qatar Airways’ support and approach during
                            these beautiful times and together we promise the best to our nation.”
