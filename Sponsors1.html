                            <i>‘Mutaz Essa Barshim is one of the greatest athletes of all time. He clears the bar with
                                such
                                ease, you might think he was dancing in the air, like a bird. It is precisely this
                                synthesis
                                of elegance and performance that drew me to him.’</i>

                            Richard Mille

                            It was during the Rio 2016 Olympics that Mutaz met Richard Mille, who had been following the
                            competition closely. This was the moment when the RM 67-02 was conceived.

                            ​​<i>‘We talked specifically about something extremely light
                                and flexible, very flat,
                                something
                                that would not distract me from concentrating during my jumps. It has given me so much
                                support during the challenges I faced in reaching the World Championships and other big
                                venues across the globe. I expect it to feel like part of my body, part of my skin, part
                                of
                                me. My discipline requires the ultimate from me physically : I need to be light in
                                weight
                                yet extremely accurate with every step I make, just like every ‘tick’ of my watch. My
                                body
                                is the only ‘tool’ I have in my sport; I don’t use a club or racquet or other external
                                aids.
                                What I do is very ‘pure’, it’s just me up against the challenge. I want my watch to be
                                similar: very pure, very accurate, very perfect, yet as light as possible, and totally
                                reliable, without question. Mutaz Essa Barshim</i>

                            <b>LUX:</b> Why Richard Mille out of any of the people that you could have partnered with?
                            <br />
                            <b>MEB:</b> He is simply the best!
                            <br />
                            <b>LUX:</b> How did you come to partner with Richard Mille?
                            <br />
                            <b>MEB:</b> The first time I met Richard was in the Rio Olympics after my competition. We
                            talked
                            and he is a really nice, friendly guy. He told me he loved the way I jump and he wanted me
                            to join him in the family. I said, of course I’d be very happy to. We had been talking about
                            the watch and he asked me if I jump with watches. I said no, because they’re too heavy.
                            Richard said that he could make something very light for me. So I said, let’s do it! I know
                            about Nadal’s RM27-03 Tourbillon watch and it is very light. He said he could do it even
                            lighter than that and I was very impressed. Since then, we have been talking back and forth
                            and sharing ideas.
                            <br />
                            <b>LUX:</b> Were you involved in the design process?
                            <br />
                            <b>MEB:</b> Initially, the main target was for me to jump with it – something that wouldn’t
                            affect
                            my jump. It wouldn’t be worth it if it was something heavy that disturbed my performance.
                            Since we realised that he could make something lighter, we discussed design. We thought it
                            could be something with maroon and white, to match my kit. I wanted something elegant and
                            sexy – I didn’t want it to be thought of as a sport watch.
                            <br />
                            <b>LUX:</b> You said that the watch came out of a necessity for being light. Would they
                            bring you
                            designs that you would tweak, or were you given final products?
                            <br />
                            <b>MEB:</b> Firstly, we would get a prototype drawing. This would be computerised and
                            three-dimensional. He would ask what I thought. I wanted to see a side angle picture, so I
                            could see how thin the watch was. He said it was so thin that I won’t be able to feel it.
                            When I saw the picture, I was really impressed. He would then show me the back and ask my
                            preferences and how I wanted it to be engraved. What shall we write down? We would discuss
                            the colours and how to change them. Of course, none of the mechanics is to do with me. It’s
                            all his work and genius. I think asking him about the mechanics would be disrespectful,
                            because I know he would make it the best. When it came to the final product, I really was
                            impressed!
                            <br />
                            <b>LUX:</b> There is a symbiosis and as you said, you needed something that didn’t affect
                            you when
                            you jumped. What are the commonalities between your practice and your watch?
                            <br />
                            <b>MEB:</b> Quality. It is the main objective. High jumpers don’t use any objects, they just
                            have
                            to use their bodies in the perfect way, otherwise you will injure yourself. Timing – a few
                            seconds can make a difference between a perfect jump and a really bad jump. You could lose a
                            medal. That’s what this watch is about – quality and timing. Ticking at the right moments. I
                            want something sexy and elegant, with quality and timing.
                            <br />
                            <b>LUX:</b> By being in the Richard Mille family – you are amongst some of the best
                            sportsmen and
                            women. How does it feel?
                            <br />
                            <b>MEB:</b> It feels great. The one thing I really love about Richard and how he selects his
                            athletes and ambassadors, is that everybody is so humble and down-to-earth. He is not only
                            selecting people because of what they achieve in sport. He also looks at their social
                            energy, what they value in society and how they interact with different people. I’ve met
                            most of the guys and everybody is so nice. They are so inspiring and they are role models. I
                            feel that is the type of character he wants. Once you’re in, you’re in – it is a family. You
                            don’t want to bring someone in that will destroy this family. Everybody is highly
                            professional, but at the same time they are very nice people. It is just a pleasure to be
                            among them.
