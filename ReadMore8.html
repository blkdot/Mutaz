                    The 45-minute long workout includes stretching, box jumps, weights, chin ups, knee tucks, leg curls
                    and planks, and is perfect for both men and women who aim to increase their power. “I fight gravity
                    so I work on leg and core strength,” said Barshim. “During every leg drill, focus on keeping your
                    core strong at the same time.”
                    <br />
                    As well, Nike has featured a giant image of Barshim in action on the side of Warwick Hotel Dubai,
                    showcasing the height that he’s aiming for. The 110m poster was designed to inspire the average
                    athlete to aim higher and push themselves further to reach their goals.
