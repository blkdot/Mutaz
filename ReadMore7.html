                    The snapshot:<br />
                    October 2019, Khalifa International Stadium, Doha, Qatar. World high jump champion Mutaz Essa
                    Barshim attempted to become the first man in history to successfully defend that particular title –
                    and he had to do it in less than perfect physical condition.
                    <br />
                    The credentials:<br />
                    As well as winning the 2017 World Championships in London, with a leap of 2.35m, Barshim is a double
                    Olympic medalist and came within two centimetres of equalling Javier Sotomayor’s longstanding world
                    record of 2.45m. Barshim’s career-best leap of 2.43m, achieved in Brussels, Belgium in 2014, is the
                    second-highest of all-time and the closest anyone has come to breaking Sotomayor’s mark, which was
                    set way back in 1993.
                    <br />
                    The background:<br />
                    Almost exactly 12 months before the 2019 World Championships, retaining his 2017 world title
                    appeared highly unlikely at best after Barshim twisted his ankle in Hungary, leading to what he
                    described as a “nightmare” lay-off.
                    “I think one year ago [before the World Championships] I got off the crutches and I took my first
                    step,” he revealed. “My injury was very serious, it could have been career-ending. Then you start
                    questioning yourself – it’s normal when you’re facing a difficult situation.”
                    But Barshim wasn’t going to let this setback stop him from giving it everything he had to land gold
                    in front of his fans.
                    “I felt like, OK it doesn’t matter what happens tonight, if I injure myself, if it’s my last
                    competition, I’m going to push everything out,” he said.
