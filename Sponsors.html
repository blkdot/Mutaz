                                such
                                ease, you might think he was dancing in the air, like a bird. It is precisely this
                                synthesis
                                of elegance and performance that drew me to him.’</i>

                            Richard Mille

                            It was during the Rio 2016 Olympics that Mutaz met Richard Mille, who had been following the
                            competition closely. This was the moment when the RM 67-02 was conceived.

                            ​​<i>‘We talked specifically about something extremely light
                                and flexible, very flat,
                                something
                                that would not distract me from concentrating during my jumps. It has given me so much
                                support during the challenges I faced in reaching the World Championships and other big
                                venues across the globe. I expect it to feel like part of my body, part of my skin, part
                                of
                                me. My discipline requires the ultimate from me physically : I need to be light in
                                weight
                                yet extremely accurate with every step I make, just like every ‘tick’ of my watch. My
                                body
                                is the only ‘tool’ I have in my sport; I don’t use a club or racquet or other external
                                aids.
                                What I do is very ‘pure’, it’s just me up against the challenge. I want my watch to be
                                similar: very pure, very accurate, very perfect, yet as light as possible, and totally
                                reliable, without question. Mutaz Essa Barshim</i>

                            <b>LUX:</b> Why Richard Mille out of any of the people that you could have partnered with?
                            <br />
                            <b>MEB:</b> He is simply the best!
                            <br />
                            <b>LUX:</b> How did you come to partner with Richard Mille?
                            <br />
                            <b>MEB:</b> The first time I met Richard was in the Rio Olympics after my competition. We
                            talked
                            and he is a really nice, friendly guy. He told me he loved the way I jump and he wanted me
                            to join him in the family. I said, of course I’d be very happy to. We had been talking about
                            the watch and he asked me if I jump with watches. I said no, because they’re too heavy.
                            Richard said that he could make something very light for me. So I said, let’s do it! I know
                            about Nadal’s RM27-03 Tourbillon watch and it is very light. He said he could do it even
                            lighter than that and I was very impressed. Since then, we have been talking back and forth
                            and sharing ideas.
                            <br />
                            <b>LUX:</b> Were you involved in the design process?
                            <br />
                            <b>MEB:</b> Initially, the main target was for me to jump with it – something that wouldn’t
                            affect
                            my jump. It wouldn’t be worth it if it was something heavy that disturbed my performance.
                            Since we realised that he could make something lighter, we discussed design. We thought it
                            could be something with maroon and white, to match my kit. I wanted something elegant and
                            sexy – I didn’t want it to be thought of as a sport watch.
                            <br />
                            <b>LUX:</b> You said that the watch came out of a necessity for being light. Would they
                            bring you
                            designs that you would tweak, or were you given final products?
                            <br />
                            <b>MEB:</b> Firstly, we would get a prototype drawing. This would be computerised and
                            three-dimensional. He would ask what I thought. I wanted to see a side angle picture, so I
                            could see how thin the watch was. He said it was so thin that I won’t be able to feel it.
                            When I saw the picture, I was really impressed. He would then show me the back and ask my
                            preferences and how I wanted it to be engraved. What shall we write down? We would discuss
                            the colours and how to change them. Of course, none of the mechanics is to do with me. It’s
                            all his work and genius. I think asking him about the mechanics would be disrespectful,
                            because I know he would make it the best. When it came to the final product, I really was
                            impressed!
                            <br />
                            <b>LUX:</b> There is a symbiosis and as you said, you needed something that didn’t affect
                            you when
                            you jumped. What are the commonalities between your practice and your watch?
                            <br />
                            <b>MEB:</b> Quality. It is the main objective. High jumpers don’t use any objects, they just
                            have
                            to use their bodies in the perfect way, otherwise you will injure yourself. Timing – a few
                            seconds can make a difference between a perfect jump and a really bad jump. You could lose a
                            medal. That’s what this watch is about – quality and timing. Ticking at the right moments. I
                            want something sexy and elegant, with quality and timing.
                            <br />
                            <b>LUX:</b> By being in the Richard Mille family – you are amongst some of the best
                            sportsmen and
                            women. How does it feel?
                            <br />
                            <b>MEB:</b> It feels great. The one thing I really love about Richard and how he selects his
                            athletes and ambassadors, is that everybody is so humble and down-to-earth. He is not only
                            selecting people because of what they achieve in sport. He also looks at their social
                            energy, what they value in society and how they interact with different people. I’ve met
                            most of the guys and everybody is so nice. They are so inspiring and they are role models. I
                            feel that is the type of character he wants. Once you’re in, you’re in – it is a family. You
                            don’t want to bring someone in that will destroy this family. Everybody is highly
                            professional, but at the same time they are very nice people. It is just a pleasure to be
                            among them.

                            Qatar Airways is excited to announce a partnership with Olympic Gold medallist and Qatari
                            high jump star and sports icon, Mutaz Barshim, further diversifying the airline’s renowned
                            sports sponsorships portfolio.
                            <br />
                            After immediately making an impact at the young age of 19 by setting the Qatari high jump
                            record, Barshim consequently went on to set new standards by recording the second highest
                            jump of all time at 2.43 metres. The award-winning athlete has attained several prestigious
                            accolades over the years, which include the recent gold medal at 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the
                            gold medal at the World Championships in 2017 and 2019, respectively, and the silver medal
                            at 2016 Rio Olympics. His gravity defying performances merited the award for ‘2017 Athlete
                            of the Year’ by the Association of National Olympic Committee and ‘Best Track & Field
                            Athlete of 2017’ by the International Association of Athletics Federation, amongst several
                            others.
                            <br />
                            Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive, His Excellency Mr. Akbar Al Baker, said: “Mutaz Barshim
                            holds high recognition amongst the world’s most renowned athletes, having amassed a
                            portfolio of high jump titles. As we celebrate his latest win at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, we
                            could not be more proud, and we hope that Barshim continues to soar high and set new
                            records, which will create a ripple effect of inspiring young athletes within Qatar and
                            around the world. We are continually striving to boost our global sports sponsorship
                            portfolio, and this partnership is just one more example of our dedication to sports and our
                            belief in its power to bring people together.”

                            Qatari High Jump Athlete, Mutaz Barshim, said: “‘I am happy and excited for this partnership
                            with the world’s best airline. I truly appreciate Qatar Airways’ support and approach during
                            these beautiful times and together we promise the best to our nation.”

                            Team Oakley Athlete, Mutaz Barshim is the winner of a gold medal from the High Jump
                            tournament. The Qatari athlete made a historic win after agreeing to share the champion
                            title with Italian athlete Gianmarco Tamberi after scoring an impressive 2.63m score.
                            <br />
                            During the high-jump athletics tournament, Mutaz wore Oakley Kato Prizm 24K, a colourway
                            that was launched specifically with the Olympics in mind.
                            A huge congratulations to Mutaz on his spectacular win and brilliant show of sportsmanship!
                            <br /><br /><br />

                            The sartorial star of the high jump could have been the pair of Oakley Kato sunglasses that
                            Barshim wore throughout the night competition. These weren’t exactly functional. It was, of
                            course, dark, and shadows flew off his face pretty much every time he walked through the
                            bar. (As the camera cut him off as he readjusted them before each jump, the stripes on the
                            track were reflected in the sci-fi lenses, mirroring the stripes on the Qatari Olympic
                            uniform. Deeply futuristic wrap-around sunglasses have been booming for quite some time now,
                            although in the world of professional sports they’ve never really been released. While the
                            Katos are currently sold out on the Oakley website due to high demand, if you are
                            considering purchasing a pair, now may be the time to get on the waitlist. However, you
                            might be competing with a gold medalist: as a New York Times reported, in the moments after
                            their post-gold embrace, Barshim actually broke the glasses he was wearing. “It’s good,” he
                            said. “I have about 50 pairs.”

                            <br />
                            The agreement was signed at Ooredoo Headquarters by Sheikh

                            Barshim is a Qatari track and field athlete and a triple Olympic medallist (one gold and two
                            silver) in the high jump. The current World Champion and second best high jumper of
                            all-time, with a personal best of 2.43 metres, he won gold at the 2017 World Championships

                            Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulla Al Thani said: “Ooredoo’s sponsorship of Mutaz Barshim is one of
                            several initiatives from the company to encourage sports education and inspire more young
                            people to take up a sport of their own, as part of our corporate social responsibility. To
                            date, Barshim has demonstrated through his career the positive values of fair play and
                            sporting excellence.”

                            “From amateur, grass-roots sports to the highest standards of performance at national and
                            international, Ooredoo aims to be there supporting our athletes,” he added.
                            <br />
                            Mutaz Barshim welcomed Ooredoo’s support and praised its role in supporting athletes and
                            motivating them to excel, stressing that this sponsorship represents an incentive for him to
                            continue success and excellence in the upcoming competitions.

                            Sports company PUMA has signed Qatari athlete Mutaz Essa Barshim, one of the most successful
                            high jumpers of all time, who will wear the company’s performance products starting at the
                            Diamond League Meeting in Lausanne.

                            <br /><br /><br />
                            With three World Championships and an Olympic Gold to his name, Barshim has already won
                            everything there is to win in his sport. At the World Championships in Eugene this year, he
                            successfully defended his title and showed he is still on top of his game.
                            “We are so happy to welcome Mutaz to our PUMA Family,” said Pascal Rolling, Head of Sports
                            Marketing. “He is an incredibly talented athlete, and his charm and sportsmanship has done
                            much to promote athletics across the globe.”
                            <br /><br /><br />

                            <br /><br /><br />
                            Famously, Barshim and Italian PUMA athlete Gianmarco Tamberi decided to share the Gold at
                            the Olympic Games in Tokyo after jumping the same height, creating memorable moments of
                            fairness and comradery.
                            Barshim’s personal best of 2.43 meters is the Asian Record and the second-highest jump of
                            all time. At PUMA, Barshim is part of a group of world-class athletes such as 400m hurdles
                            World Record Holder Karsten Warholm, pole vault World Record Holder Armand “Mondo” Duplantis
                            and Jamaican sprinters Shericka Jackson and Elaine Thompson-Herah.
