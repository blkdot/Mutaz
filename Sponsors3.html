                            Team Oakley Athlete, Mutaz Barshim is the winner of a gold medal from the High Jump
                            tournament. The Qatari athlete made a historic win after agreeing to share the champion
                            title with Italian athlete Gianmarco Tamberi after scoring an impressive 2.63m score.
                            <br />
                            During the high-jump athletics tournament, Mutaz wore Oakley Kato Prizm 24K, a colourway
                            that was launched specifically with the Olympics in mind.
                            A huge congratulations to Mutaz on his spectacular win and brilliant show of sportsmanship!
                            <br /><br /><br />

                            The sartorial star of the high jump could have been the pair of Oakley Kato sunglasses that
                            Barshim wore throughout the night competition. These weren’t exactly functional. It was, of
                            course, dark, and shadows flew off his face pretty much every time he walked through the
                            bar. (As the camera cut him off as he readjusted them before each jump, the stripes on the
                            track were reflected in the sci-fi lenses, mirroring the stripes on the Qatari Olympic
                            uniform. Deeply futuristic wrap-around sunglasses have been booming for quite some time now,
                            although in the world of professional sports they’ve never really been released. While the
                            Katos are currently sold out on the Oakley website due to high demand, if you are
                            considering purchasing a pair, now may be the time to get on the waitlist. However, you
                            might be competing with a gold medalist: as a New York Times reported, in the moments after
                            their post-gold embrace, Barshim actually broke the glasses he was wearing. “It’s good,” he
                            said. “I have about 50 pairs.”
