                <p>Mutaz Barshim is participating in F1 in Qatar</p>
                <p>
                    <br />
                    The Qatar Motor and Motorcycle Federation (QMMF) yesterday launched a campaign across its social
                    media channels to engage the community in motorsports in Qatar and urge fans to buy the last
                    remaining tickets for the 2021 Formula 1 Ooredoo Qatar Grand Prix.<br />
                    The ‘Losail Star Power’ campaign taps into Qatar’s deep reservoir of local and international stars
                    from across the world of sport and entertainment for a head-to-head fastest lap contest at the
                    Losail International Circuit.
                    The stars include Qatari Olympic Gold medallist Mutaz Essa Barshim, three-time Dakar Rally winner
                    Nasser Saleh al-Attiyah, and French football World Cup winner Marcel Desailly.<br />
                    Videos of the competition will be posted all week at the @losailcircuit and @QMMFofficial accounts
                    on Twitter and Instagram before the winner with the fastest time is declared.<br />
                    In just two weeks from now, the lights at the Losail International Circuit will turn green for the
                    2021 Formula 1 Ooredoo Qatar Grand Prix.<br />
                    The race weekend, which runs from November 19-21, will include three days of racing, an airshow, a
                    dedicated fanzone with activities, catering options for every taste, plus a range of other
                    entertainment options, which will be revealed at later stage.<br />
                    QMMF’s Executive Director Amro al-Hamad, said: “This campaign is all about seizing the opportunity
                    we have with F1 to promote motorsports in Qatar and generate excitement before the race action
                    begins on November19. Formula 1 is one of the most popular sports in the world, and to host a race
                    in Qatar further cements Qatar’s position as a world-class venue for global sporting events.”<br />
                    Commenting on the ‘Losail Star Power’ campaign, al-Hamad said: “I’d like to thank all of our guests
                    for taking part in this campaign. We want to involve our local community in F1 through our social
                    media platforms, where they can learn more about Formula 1, the upcoming race, and motorsports in
                    general. There are still limited F1 tickets available at the Losail International Circuit website
                    for people who want to come and enjoy the race.”
                    Qatar is hosting a Formula 1 race for the first time, after stepping in at short notice to ensure a
                    full F1 race calendar for the 2021 season.<br />
                    There will be no race in 2022 as it coincides with Qatar’s hosting of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The
                    race will return to Qatar in 2023 and take place for the next 10 years until 2032.<br />
                    Tickets are available at the Losail International Circuit website:
