                            Rio, 1 August 2016. He is a World Champion in high jump, he won a bronze medal for Qatar at
                            the 2012 London Olympics and some say it’s only a matter of time until be breaks the world
                            record. Aspire Academy graduate Mutaz Essa Barshim keeps challenging gravity on a daily
                            basis, which makes him one of Qatar’s great medal hopes for the 2016 Olympic Games.
                            <br /><br />
                            “What gravity huh?!!” The slogan on his caps says it all. Mutaz does not believe in limits.
                            And many people don’t only see him as one of the candidates for the podium in Rio, but also
                            one of the jumpers most likely to one day break Javier Sotomayor’s high jump world record of
                            2.45m. Are these high expectations more a curse than a blessing for the 25-year-old? “For
                            sure, the more successful you become, the more people expect of you. But I always try to
                            look on the positive side. So: Motivation rather than pressure. And obviously I’m doing what
                            I love.”
                            <br /><br />
                            Mutaz comes from a family with a passion for sports: All five of his siblings are into
                            sports; his younger brother Moamer is following in his footsteps as a high jumper and came
                            second only to Mutaz at the GCC Athletics Championships in Doha in 2013. Father Essa Mohamed
                            Barshim was a middle- and long-distance runner before turning to coaching. “As a kid I
                            played football, like most boys. It was my father who introduced me to track and field. Al
                            Rayyan coach Abdul Hamdi spotted my talent and I then joined the long, triple and high jump
                            teams.”

                        Al Kuwari joined the ceremony, which was held in the souq area of the QOC’s hospitality

                        great athletes and dream of standing on the podium at the Olympic Games. Today, at the age
                        of 25, I celebrate winning my second Olympic medal and for me that is such a blessing. It
                        was a great competition and having HE Sheikh Joaan bin Hamad Al Thani in the crowd
                        supporting me every step of the way was extra motivation. Not only that, but the first call
                        I received after the competition was from the Emir HH Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani
                        himself.
