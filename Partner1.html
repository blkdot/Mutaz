                        <br /><br /><br /><br />
                        The Qatar Olympic Committee (QOC) celebrated one of the proudest moments in its history as
                        high jumper Mutaz Barshim was welcomed to Bayt Qatar in Rio as the nation’s first ever
                        Olympic silver medalist.

                        QOC President HE Sheikh Joaan bin Hamad Al Thani and Secretary General Dr Thani Abdulrahman
                        Al Kuwari joined the ceremony, which was held in the souq area of the QOC’s hospitality
                        house.

                        Brazilian as well as Qatari crowd turned up in large numbers waving the white and maroon
                        flag and joining the celebrations which was held in the true spirit of Olympism.

                        Speaking at the stage, Mutaz said, “When I was young I used to watch my father and other
                        great athletes and dream of standing on the podium at the Olympic Games. Today, at the age
                        of 25, I celebrate winning my second Olympic medal and for me that is such a blessing. It
                        was a great competition and having HE Sheikh Joaan bin Hamad Al Thani in the crowd
                        supporting me every step of the way was extra motivation. Not only that, but the first call
                        I received after the competition was from the Emir HH Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani
                        himself.

                        As well Mutaz participate in National Sport Day’s event organized by QOC.
